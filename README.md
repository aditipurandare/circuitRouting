parsingCode.py parses through a DSN file to create a matrix that represents component connections.
To run parsingCode, put the file path for the DSN files between "" in line 6. Replace any '\' with '\\'.
In line 7, enter the file name between "". For example, "parsingSample.txt", or "ecc.txt" 
The DSN files should be saved as .txt files in the same folder as parsingCode.py.
Two sample DSN files saved as .txt files are uploaded with the code.
